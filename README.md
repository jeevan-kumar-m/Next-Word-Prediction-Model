# Next Word Prediction Model using Python and TensorFlow-Keras

## Overview

This repository contains code to build a Next Word Prediction model using Python and TensorFlow-Keras. Next word prediction is a language modeling task in machine learning that aims to predict the most probable word or sequence of words that follows a given input context. The model utilizes statistical patterns and linguistic structures to generate accurate predictions based on the context provided.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Importing Required Libraries**: Import the necessary libraries including numpy, tensorflow, and components from tensorflow.keras.

2. **Read the Text File**: Read the text file containing the input text data.

3. **Tokenize the Text**: Tokenize the text to create a sequence of words.

4. **Create Input-Output Pairs**: Split the text into sequences of tokens and form n-grams from the sequences.

5. **Optimizing Sequence Length for Input Sequences**: Determine the maximum sequence length and pad sequences accordingly.

6. **Assigning Variables for Sequence Processing**: Assign input and output variables for sequence processing.

7. **Conversion to One-Hot Encoded Labels in TensorFlow-Keras**: Convert output labels to one-hot encoded format.

8. **Model Definition**: Define the sequential model architecture.

9. **Model Compilation and Training**: Compile and train the model using categorical crossentropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

10. **Generate Predictions**: Generate predictions for next words based on seed text.

## Conclusion

Next word prediction is a language modelling task in Machine Learning that aims to predict the most probable word or sequence of words that follows a given input context. This task utilizes statistical patterns and linguistic structures to generate accurate predictions based on the context provided.
